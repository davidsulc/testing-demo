# Desmonstration of Scripted Testing Capabilites with Selenium and Cucumber

This small project demonstrates a scripted approach to testing website functionality. This approach offers easiers maintainability when compared to (e.g.) "record-playback" testing approaches. In addition, by using proper feature definitions, the testing scenarios can be read and reviewed by non-technical stakeholders. In some cases, it is even possible for non-technical stakeholders to independently create their own testing scenarios, to be used as a user acceptance criterion.
